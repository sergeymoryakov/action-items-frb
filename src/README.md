# action-items

A simple action items list to practice Firebase

Set up the HTML structure:

Create an input field for users to enter new to-do items.
Create a button to add the item to the list.
Create an empty unordered list (<ul>) to display the to-do items.

Add event listeners and functions:

Add an event listener to the "Add" button to capture when it's clicked.
In the event listener function, retrieve the value entered in the input field.
Create a new list item (<li>) dynamically using JavaScript with the entered value.
Append the new list item to the unordered list.

Implement removing items:

Add an event listener to each list item to capture when it's clicked.
In the event listener function, remove the clicked list item from the DOM.

Implement marking items as completed:

Add a CSS class to the completed list items to change their appearance.
